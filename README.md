# Around
Around: A Cloud and React-based Social Network
----
  * Frontend
    * Designed and implemented a geo-based social network web application with React JS.<br>
    * Implemented features for users to create and browse posts and support search nearby posts (Ant Design, GeoLocation API and Google Map API.)<br>
    * Improved the authentication using token-based registration/login/logout flow with React Router v4 and server-side user authentication with JWT.<br> 
  * Backend
    * Launched a scalable web service in Go to handle posts and deployed to Google Cloud (Google Kubernetes Engine)<br>
    * Used ElasticSearch (deployed to GCE) to provide geo-location based search functions such that users can search nearby posts within a distance (e.g. 200km)<br>
    * Used Google Vision API to provide a face detection model and integrate with the Go service.<br>
